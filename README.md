# Advance Mentorship Program Website

## Getting Started

We use React for our frontend, which is located in `/client`, and node for our backend, located in `/server`.

On your local machine, you'll need to run them separately. First, run `npm install --save` from the root directory and from `/client`. To run the frontend, cd into `/client` and run npm start. To start the backend, run `npm run dev` from the root directory. The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000/`, and the backend on `http://localhost:4000/`.
